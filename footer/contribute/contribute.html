            <h1>Project contribution</h1>
            <p>If you're a programmer of just fluent of how the megadrive code works and you're in love with road rash 3, you can help with
                following things:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li> Work out if there is a strict logic of how "hills jumping" mechanics works. Sometimes bike don't fly up even on a huge hills
                        like italy's one </li>
                    <li> Exctract all dialogues from road rash as a screenshosts(preferable) or just text. I'm just curious of this type of content;
                        and i would like to place it up here</li>
                    <li>Find out if there is a secret mechanics like getting wild thing 2000 without using a cheats or maybe getting extra boosts etc.</li>
                    <li>Maybe you can find out what is true ending is supposed to be by observing code. I think there is a sort of ending, but 
                        just because of platform restrictions it has been cut or doesn't work properly, but it can be there</li>
                </ol>
                <p>If you're just enthusiast and liked the resource, you can contribute by sending some bucks via paypal on banfollowesme@mail.ru to share hosting/domain payments.</p>
